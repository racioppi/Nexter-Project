# Nexter Project

This is a project from Jonas Schmedtmann's course "Advanced CSS and Sass".

With a complex grid structure, the project's goal is to dive into CSS Grid and learn a lot from it.

Here I added some media queries decisions that were not in the original project and some styles as well.
